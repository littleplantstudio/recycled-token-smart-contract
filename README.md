# Recycled Token (RCT) Proposal

## Introduction
The Recycled Token (RCT) is an innovative and eco-friendly cryptocurrency designed to leverage blockchain technology to incentivize recycling and sustainable practices. This proposal outlines the design and features of RCT, inspired by the Bitcoin token machine, with unique mechanisms to reward users for their eco-conscious activities.

## Objectives
- Incentivize recycling and eco-friendly behavior through blockchain rewards.
- Enable cross-chain interactions to broaden the reach and usability of the token.
- Integrate with NFT standards to support eco-friendly digital collectibles.
- Ensure a decentralized, ownerless token post-deployment.

## Features

### Burn and Mint Mechanism
- Any wallet can burn various tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH, DOGE, and NFTs) and mint RCT as a reward.
- The system supports listing and delisting of burnable tokens through community voting.

### Community Voting
- Wallets holding more than 100 RCT can vote to list or delist burnable tokens.
- This ensures a democratic and decentralized governance process.

### Rewards Mechanism
- Users receive rewards for interacting with the token contract.
- Block rewards mechanism similar to Bitcoin, where tokens are minted and distributed based on blocks mined.

### Automatic Minting
- RCT is not pre-minted; it is dynamically minted.
- For every 100 transactions, 1 RCT is automatically minted and sent to a designated fund wallet.
- For every 1000 burn transactions, an NFT is minted using a Random Number Generator (RNG) and transferred to a randomly selected wallet.

### NFT Support (ERC-1155)
- Supports ERC-1155 NFTs, allowing the creation and trading of eco-friendly digital assets.
- NFTs are distributed as rewards for burn transactions, enhancing user engagement and participation.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility
- Supports cross-chain interactions, allowing the use of RCT on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains.
- Integration with swap brigades facilitates seamless token swaps across different chains.

### Decentralized Governance
- After deployment, the token will have no owner, ensuring full decentralization and community governance.
- Governance decisions, including the listing and delisting of burnable tokens, will be made through community voting mechanisms.

## Technical Specifications

### Token Details
- **Token Name**: Recycled Token (RCT)
- **Token Symbol**: RCT
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20 (with additional features for ERC-1155 NFT support)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: Not pre-minted, dynamically generated through interactions.

### Smart Contract Functions
- `burnAndMint(address user, uint256 amount, address token)`: Allows users to burn specified tokens and mint RCT.
- `rewardUser(address user, uint256 amount)`: Rewards users for interacting with the token contract.
- `mintToFundWallet(uint256 amount)`: Mints RCT directly to the fund wallet every 100 transactions.
- `mintNFTReward()`: Mints an NFT as a reward for every 1000 burn transactions using RNG.
- `voteToListToken(address token)`: Allows eligible wallets to vote for listing a new burnable token.
- `voteToDelistToken(address token)`: Allows eligible wallets to vote for delisting a burnable token.

## Governance and Decentralization
- **No Ownership**: The contract will renounce ownership post-deployment to ensure full decentralization.
- **Community Governance**: Token holders can propose and vote on key decisions, including listing and delisting burnable tokens.

## Implementation Plan

### Development
- Complete the development of the smart contract with all specified features.

### Testing
- Conduct thorough testing on testnets to ensure functionality and security.

### Deployment
- Deploy the token on the Ethereum mainnet and other EVM-compatible chains.

### Promotion
- Launch marketing campaigns to raise awareness and encourage community engagement.

### Community Building
- Foster a strong community through regular updates, transparent communication, and incentives for participation.
